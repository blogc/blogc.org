-------------------------
I just released version `0.13.7` of blogc. This is a minor release,
including the following changes:

- Users can now run [`blogc-git-receiver(1)`](/man/blogc-git-receiver.1.html)
  in shared hosting enviromnents, if they have SSH access.
- If `atom_posts_per_page` and `posts_per_page` settings for
  [`blogc-make(1)`](/man/blogc-make.1.html) are set to zero, index listings
  and Atom feeds are not built, instead of producing "empty" files.
- Fixed some other minor issues.

Thanks,  
Rafael
