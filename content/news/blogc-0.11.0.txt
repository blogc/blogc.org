-------------------------
I just released version ``0.11.0`` of blogc. This release adds the ``else``
statement for templates (finally!!), and adds some UTF-8 validation (source
files and templates must have valid UTF-8 content).

For download links, please visit [[https://blogc.rgm.io]].

Thanks,  
Rafael
