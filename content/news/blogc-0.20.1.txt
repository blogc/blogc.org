TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.20.1
DATE: 2021-01-02 23:12:00
-------------------------
I just released version `0.20.1` of blogc.

This release includes the following minor changes:

* Fixed sorting of posts in [`blogc(1)`](/man/blogc.1.html) when some post's
  `DATE` was before `Sun Sep 9 01:46:40 AM UTC 2001`.
* Simplified utf-8 implementation.

Starting with this release we are providing a new [Debian/Ubuntu repository]
(/deb-repository/) with packages for [`blogc(1)`](/man/blogc.1.html) and the
helper tools.

On the other hand, I left the Gentoo development team, and the Gentoo package is
orphaned right now. If you are a Gentoo user and have some interest maintaining
it, please adopt.

For download links, project details and a FAQ, please visit

Thanks,  
Rafael
