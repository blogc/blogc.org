-------------------------
I just released version `0.15.0` of blogc.

This is release includes some predefined internal template variables, to show
some build metadata in websites. See
[``blogc-template(7)``](https://blogc.rgm.io/man/blogc-template.7.html)
for details.

This release also fixes a bug when using whitespace characters like ``\r``,
``\n`` and ``\t`` in template blocks, conditionals and variables, instead of
just spaces (``' '``). These characters where not allowed previously.

For download links, project details and a FAQ, please visit

Thanks,  
Rafael
