-------------------------
I just released version `0.13.3` of blogc. This release contains some fixes for
bugs detected with `clang-analyzer`. Now our
[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/blogc/blogc) runs `clang-analyzer` after
every push to the Git repository.

For download links, project details and a FAQ, please visit

Thanks,  
Rafael
