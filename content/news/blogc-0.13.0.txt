TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.13.0
DATE: 2017-12-25
-------------------------
After more than one year, we are releasing blogc ``0.13.0``. This is a special
release, with lots of features. The release was actually cut more than 1 month
ago, but this is the time for the announcement!

- blogc now includes a new helper tool: [`blogc-make(1)`](./man/blogc-make.1.html),
  that is a build tool for blogc, and should be enough for the needs of most
  users. See the manpages for a complete list of features. This tool is POSIX-only
  for now, but patches porting it to Windows are welcome.
- blogc can be used as an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
  function, to deploy websites directly to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/),
  triggered by [GitHub](https://github.com) changes. This is currently not
  documented, but users with some AWS Lambda experience should be able to make it
  work by looking at the function code. The lambda function zip file can be
  found in our Github release page:
  [[https://github.com/blogc/blogc/releases/tag/v0.13.0]]. Documentation will be
  added soon.
- Lots of minor fixes for `blogc-git-receiver(1)` and improvements to allow
  re-running the build hooks manually.
- Lots of improvements for `blogc-runserver(1)`, including IPv6 support, better
  socket handling, allow users to define default host and port using environment
  variables, etc.
- Some random template engine, loader and content parser fixes and new features.

Yeah, this is a really huge release. Please check the
[changelog](https://github.com/blogc/blogc/compare/v0.12.0...v0.13.0) for more
details.
