TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.7.2

-------------------------
I just released version ``0.7.2`` of blogc. This release fixes a bug when
rendering an `if` statement that evaluates to `false` right after another
`if` statement that evaluates to `true`. This bug was causing segmentation
faults for some source files and all users are asked to upgrade.

For download links, please visit [[https://blogc.rgm.io]].
Windows users can find prebuilt binaries in the web page sidebar.

Thanks,  
Rafael
