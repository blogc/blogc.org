TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.13.4

-------------------------
I just released version `0.13.4` of blogc. This is a minor release with some
bug fixes and a minor `blogc-make(1)` feature:

- When running commands, `blogc-make(1)` will show the command's `STDERR`
  always, to avoid suppressing `blogc(1)` warnings.
- When setting `posts_per_page` to `-1` in `blogcfile(5)`, the pagination
  features are disabled, and all the posts are included in the template
  `listing` blocks.

This release includes a minor change in `blogc(1)` previous behavior:

- When setting `FILTER_PER_PAGE` to `0` or negative, no posts are listed,
  instead of listing `10` by default.

Thanks,
