-------------------------
I just released version ``0.10.2`` of blogc. This release fixes some invalid
HTML that was generated when invalid syntax was parsed from content files, the
parser was mostly rewrote. This release also adds some basic debug support for
templates, see ``blogc(1)``.

For download links, please visit [[https://blogc.rgm.io]].
Windows users can find prebuilt binaries in the web page sidebar.

Thanks,  
Rafael
