TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.13.5
DATE: 2018-05-14
-------------------------
I just released version `0.13.5` of blogc. This is a minor release,
including the following changes:

- Added a `watch` rule to `blogc-make(1)`. This rule allows the usage of
  the automatic website reloader/rebuilder without using `blogc-runserver(1)`.
- Changed the architecture of the `blogc-make(1)` `runserver` rule.

Thanks,
