TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.6
DATE: 2016-01-07 03:05:00
-------------------------
I just released version ``0.6`` of blogc. This release adds a foreach
iterator to templates and fixes behaviour of the (poorly documented) post
filter by tags, that now splits tags by spaces instead of commas.

For download links, please visit [[https://blogc.rgm.io]].
Windows users can find prebuilt binaries in the web page sidebar.

Get it while it is hot!

Thanks,  
Rafael
