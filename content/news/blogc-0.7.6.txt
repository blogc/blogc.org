TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.7.6

-------------------------
I just released version ``0.7.6`` of blogc. This release replaces the internal
utilities library with [squareball](https://github.com/rafaelmartins/squareball).
The squareball library is bundled in blogc, so users don't need to care about
this change. Linux distribution packages will use a library globally installed
in the system though.

For download links, please visit [[https://blogc.rgm.io]].
Windows users can find prebuilt binaries in the web page sidebar.

Thanks,  
Rafael
