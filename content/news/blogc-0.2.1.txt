TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.2.1
DATE: 2015-10-08 03:15:00
-------------------------
I just released version ``0.2.1`` of blogc, that includes a new feature. Now
blogc accepts an empty list of source files when called with ``-l``.

This release is ``0.2.1`` because I released ``0.2`` with broken
documentation.

For download links, please visit [[http://blogc.org]].

Get it while it is hot!

Thanks,  
Rafael
