TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.7.3
DATE: 2016-02-21 00:10:00
-------------------------
I just released version ``0.7.3`` of blogc. This release fixes a bug when
the content parser finds a link after a '!' mark. It used to interpret the
link as an image, and ignore the content between the '!' mark and the link.

For download links, please visit [[https://blogc.rgm.io]].
Windows users can find prebuilt binaries in the web page sidebar.

Thanks,  
Rafael
