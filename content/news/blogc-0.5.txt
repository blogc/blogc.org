-------------------------
I just released version ``0.5`` of blogc. This release introduces fixes
a deficiency of the template parser, that couldn't do comparisions between two
variables. Thanks to [@palmer-dabbelt](https://github.com/palmer-dabbelt) for
the patch.

For download links, please visit [[http://blogc.org]].
Windows users can find prebuilt binaries in the web page sidebar.

Get it while it is hot!

Thanks,  
Rafael
