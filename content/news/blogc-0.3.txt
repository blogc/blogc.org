TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.3

-------------------------
I just released version ``0.3`` of blogc, that includes a new feature. Now
blogc adds an ``id`` attribute to the headers in the generated HTML, that
can be used to create anchor links to specific sections of your content.

For download links, please visit [[https://blogc.rgm.io]].

Get it while it is hot!

Thanks,  
Rafael
