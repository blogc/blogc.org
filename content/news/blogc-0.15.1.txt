TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.15.1

-------------------------
I just released version `0.15.1` of blogc.

This is a bugfix release, that includes the following changes:

* Backslashes won't escape inline code in source files, to be more compatible
  with [Markdown spec](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#code).
  To escape a back-tick character inside inline code, please enclose the code
  with double back-ticks.
* Simplified implementation of `BLOGC_SYSINFO_USERNAME` template variable, to
  prevent issues with static builds in glibc, due to some functions requiring
  shared libraries even when built statically.

For download links, project details and a FAQ, please visit
[[https://blogc.rgm.io]].

Thanks,  
Rafael
