TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.12.0

-------------------------
After some months, I just released version ``0.12.0`` of blogc, and it is
huge! This release includes:

- Big blogs can now be moved to ``blogc``. This version includes support to
  read the list of source files from standard input, instead of command line
  arguments. The operating system's size limit of command line arguments
  would be a problem for big blogs, when building with previous versions of
  ``blogc``.
- No more external dependencies for any of the blogc tools. This comes at the
  cost of reducing portability, but I don't think that we have lots of users
  running anything else than linux, and the tools are easily replaceable by
  something else.
- Increased test coverage. Now every tool have tests, and some "integration
  tests" were included as well.
- ``blogc-git-receiver(1)`` can read mirror URLs from a configuration file.
- Lots of bug fixes and code rework.
