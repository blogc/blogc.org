TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.16.1

-------------------------
I just released version `0.16.1` of blogc.

This is a bug fix release for `blogc-make(1)`, with the following changes:

- `blogc-make(1)` was implementing atom feeds wrong for long time. Atom IDs
  are supposed to be valid URIs. This is a small but breaking change. It is
  supposed to make some clients think that all of the old posts were
  republished. The public aggregators using my blogs' feeds do not
  republished anything, though. 
- `atom_legacy_entry_id` isn't supported by `blogcfile(5)` anymore. There's
  no point in officially supporting broken IDs. If you need it, please run
  the same command provided before.

This release is only relevant for users relying on `blogc-make(1)` *AND*
using default atom feed templates. Users with custom atom templates may
also want to make sure that their feeds are valid, though.

Users wanting to make sure that this release won't change their feeds, can
run the following command before upgrading (it assumes that templates are
stored in `templates/` and that is using the default internal atom
template):

    $ blogc-make atom_dump > templates/atom.tmpl

Please keep in mind that when using the old feed template your atom IDs are
invalid.

Thanks,
