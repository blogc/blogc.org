-------------------------
I just released version ``0.4`` of blogc. This is the first release that
officially support Microsoft Windows. It also includes a new datetime
parser, and improvements in the error reporting for the parsers.

For download links, please visit [[https://blogc.rgm.io]].
Windows users can find prebuilt binaries in the web page sidebar.

Get it while it is hot!

Thanks,  
Rafael
