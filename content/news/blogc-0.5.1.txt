TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.5.1

-------------------------
I just released version ``0.5.1`` of blogc. This release fixes handling of
locale environment variables, like ``LC_ALL``. This is useful to change
date formatting that is locale-specific.

For download links, please visit [[https://blogc.rgm.io]].
Windows users can find prebuilt binaries in the web page sidebar.

Get it while it is hot!

Thanks,  
Rafael
