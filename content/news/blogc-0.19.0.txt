-------------------------
I just released version `0.19.0` of blogc.

This release includes the following changes:

* [`blogc(1)`](/man/blogc.1.html) now accepts multiple `-e` command-line
  arguments, to allow declaration of multiple `listing_entry` template blocks.
  See [`blogc-template(7)`](/man/blogc-template.7.html) for details.
  This is not supported by [`blogc-make(1)`](/man/blogc-make.1.html), it only
  accepts one file as `listing_entry` setting.
* [`blogc(1)`](/man/blogc.1.html) now supports a `listing_empty` template
  block, that is displayed only when the the listing set is empty. See
  [`blogc-template(7)`](/man/blogc-template.7.html) for details.
* Fixed a race condition in [`blogc-make(1)`](/man/blogc-make.1.html)'s
  `runserver` command.
* Minor adjustments in [`blogc-make(1)`](/man/blogc-make.1.html) atom feed
  generation.
* Some other minor bug fixes.
