TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.14.0
DATE: 2018-07-27 23:10:00
-------------------------
I just released version `0.14.0` of blogc. This is a release, that includes
some changes, mostly in `blogc-make(1)`:

- Allow usage of empty values for the `*_prefix` settings in `blogcfile(5)`
- Fixed some bugs in the default Atom feed template. This includes a change
  in the algorithm that generates Atom IDs for every post. Users upgrading
  to this version may want to set `atom_legacy_entry_id` to `true` in
  `blogcfile(5)`, to avoid re-sharing posts due to the ID changes.
- Allow usage of custom Atom feed templates. Users can dump the default
  template to use as base for customizations, using `blogc-make(1)`
  `atom_dump` rule.
- Minor fixes to prevent segfaults.
