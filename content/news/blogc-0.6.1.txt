TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.6.1

-------------------------
I just released version ``0.6.1`` of blogc. This is a bugfix release, that
fixes the handling of the ``FOREACH_ITEM`` special variable. Now it can be
used as a normal variable, including ``if`` and ``endif`` statements.

For download links, please visit [[https://blogc.rgm.io]].
Windows users can find prebuilt binaries in the web page sidebar.

Get it while it is hot!

Thanks,  
Rafael
