-------------------------
I just released version `0.16.0` of blogc.

This release includes the following changes:

* Added new template block `listing_entry`, to include the content of a source
  file on a listing page. This is useful if the user wants to have an index
  page with posts listing and some content together. See
  [`blogc(1)`](/man/blogc.1.html) (description of `-e` option) and
  [`blogc-template(7)`](/man/blogc-template.7.html) for details.
* Adapted [`blogc-make(1)`](/man/blogc-make.1.html) to support the new
  `listing_entry` block. See [`blogcfile(5)`](/man/blogcfile.5.html) for
  details.
* Changed [`blogc(1)`](/man/blogc.1.html) `-p` option to be able to retrieve
  values from entries, instead of just listings. Any variables that can be used
  in templates are available, including `CONTENT`, that contains the HTML
  generated from the source file.
