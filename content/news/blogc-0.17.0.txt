TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.17.0

-------------------------
I just released version `0.17.0` of blogc.

This release includes the following changes:

* [`blogc(1)`](/man/blogc.1.html) now supports sorting source files by `DATE`
  variable, by providing the `FILTER_SORT=1` global variable. The source
  files are sorted in descending order by default, and can be reversed by
  providing the `FILTER_REVERSE=1` global variable. See
  [`blogc-pagination(7)`](/man/blogc-pagination.7.html) for details.
* [`blogc-make(1)`](/man/blogc-make.1.html) got a new setting to support
  sorting posts: `posts_sort`. See [`blogcfile(5)`](/man/blogcfile.5.html)
  for details.

Thanks,
