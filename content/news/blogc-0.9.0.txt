TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.9.0

-------------------------
I released version ``0.9.0`` of blogc a few weeks (?!) ago. This release
added support to extract a ``DESCRIPTION`` template variable from source
files, that contains the first line of the first paragraph parsed from the
source file, and is suitable to be used as HTML ``description`` meta tag.

This release also includes several project-wise changes. I decided to merge
the helper tools, namely ``blogc-git-receiver(1)`` and ``blogc-runserver(1)``,
into the main ``blogc`` distribution. Users can build these tools adding the
``--enable-git-receiver`` and ``--enable-runserver`` options to the
``./configure`` call. Gentoo users can rely on the ``git`` and ``http`` USE
flags for it, and Fedora/RHEL/CentOS users still have the packages splitted
as before.

``squareball`` library was also removed, and code was merged back to ``blogc``
repository, for easier maintenance.

Windows pre-built binaries were also dropped in this release. They were not
really useful at this point, and I'm not aware of anyone using those binaries.
Code is still supposed to build on Windows, though.
