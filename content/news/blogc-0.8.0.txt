TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.8.0
DATE: 2016-04-17 01:30:00
-------------------------
I released version ``0.8.0`` of blogc a few days ago. This release added
support to convert ``--`` and ``---`` to ``&ndash;`` and ``&mdash;`` in
source files and moved file utilities and error infrastructure code from
``blogc`` to ``squareball``.

For download links, please visit [[https://blogc.rgm.io]].
Windows users can find prebuilt binaries in the web page sidebar.

Thanks,  
Rafael
