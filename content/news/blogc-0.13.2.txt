TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.13.2
DATE: 2018-03-12 00:19:00
-------------------------
I just released version `0.13.2` of blogc. This is a minor release with some
optimizations and two minor `blogc-make(5)` features:

- Pass the `MAKE_TAGS` variable to `blogc(1)`, that contains a space-separated
  list of tags, based on the tags listed in the `[tags]` section of
  `blogcfile(5)`. This variable can be used with the `foreach` iterator to
  produce tag clouds in templates.

- Pass the `MAKE_SLUG` variable to `blogc(1)` when running the `pages` and
  `posts` build rules, that contains the slug of the page/post being built,
  as provided in `blogcfile(5). This variable can be used to highlight the
  current page in the site menu, for example.

Thanks,
