TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.14.1

-------------------------
I just released version `0.14.1` of blogc.

This is a minor release, that includes some minor code improvements and fixes
a bug in `blogc-make(1)` handling of rule names, that would previously accept
incomplete rule names, but would run all the rules that matched the prefix
substring, e.g. `atom` would match `atom`, `atom_tags`, `atom_dump`, and run
all of them in sequence. Now it will only match the exact rule names. Also,
`blogc-github-lambda` was removed from `blogc` git repository. It will be
hosted in a dedicated git repository soon.

Thanks,  
Rafael
