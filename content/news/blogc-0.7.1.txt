TITLE: [ANN] blogc-0.7.1

-------------------------
I just released version ``0.7.1`` of blogc. This release fixes a bug when
rendering code blocks from source files. HTML entities are now escaped,
instead of rendered directly.

For download links, please visit [[https://blogc.rgm.io]].
Windows users can find prebuilt binaries in the web page sidebar.

Get it while it is hot!

Thanks,  
Rafael
