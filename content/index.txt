    <h4>blogc is simple...</h4>
    <p>blogc was designed with simplicity in mind. If the implamentation of
    some feature requires a very complex change, it is just discarded.</p>
    <h4>blogc is powerful...</h4>
    <p>Based on the flexibility of its template engine, even considering
    that it just implements the basic features of a template engine, blogc
    can be used to generate almost any blog/website resource.</p>
    <h4>blogc is compatible with <code>make</code>...</h4>
    <p>blogs was designed to be used with <code>make</code>. It is stateless
    and idempotent (no global state is shared between process calls, and each
    call with the same arguments will always result in the same output), and
    works pretty much like a "real" source code compiler.</p>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h4>blogc is portable...</h4>
    <p>blogc is tested on Linux and FreeBSD, but the code should work on any
    Unix-like operating system. We have plans on supporting Windows, and you
    may be able to get it running there with Cygwin or MSYS, but usability
    can be heavily improved. Patches for portability are always welcome and
    have high priority.</p>
    <h4>blogc is self-contained...</h4>
    <p>blogc just depends on a libc. No external libraries required at all.
    The test suite (yes, blogc comes with a somewhat complete test suite!)
    depends on <a href="http://cmocka.org/">cmocka</a>, though.</p>
    <h4>blogc is designed for developers...</h4>
    <p>Due to its simplicity and similarity to a "real" source code compiler,
    blogc is meant to be used by software developers, that are used to work
    with <code>make</code> and similar development tools.</p>
