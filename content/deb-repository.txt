TITLE: Debian/Ubuntu repositories
---------------------------------
Starting from blogc `0.20.1`, we are providing a Debian/Ubuntu repository,
for the following distributions:

**Debian**

- `buster`
- `bullseye`
- `sid`

**Ubuntu**

- `focal`
- `groovy`

To install the repository, run the following commands:

    # echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://deb.rgm.io/blogc $(lsb_release -cs) main" \
           > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/blogc.list
    # echo "deb-src [trusted=yes] https://deb.rgm.io/blogc $(lsb_release -cs) main" \
           >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/blogc.list
    # apt update

With that, you should be able to install the following packages:

- `blogc`
- `blogc-git-receiver`
- `blogc-make`
- `blogc-runserver`

Please note that the repositories are generated automatically by Github-Actions,
and are not GPG-signed. This is why we have `[trusted=yes]` set in the repository
configuration.

If you do not trust these builds, you can easily build your own `deb`s from git,
using the `debian/` folder shipped there.
